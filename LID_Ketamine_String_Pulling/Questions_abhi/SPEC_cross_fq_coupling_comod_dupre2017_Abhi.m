% Requires python and the pactools library installed and tested.
%  Requires that you have a C:\Temp directory on your computer.
%  Requires that the path to python is 'C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\'
%
% Use Anaconda python and then follow the instructions on the pactools
% github website for install. You will need to figure out where the path is
% to the pythonw.exe. If the pactools install fails, you can also download
% the whole pactools project and subdirs from github and then, using the
% Anaconda command window, go to the root directory and run this...
%   >> python setup.py install
%
% See the pactools on github for more details. here are the methods.
% 'ozkurt', 'canolty', 'tort', 'penny', 'vanwijk', 'duprelatour', 'colgin', 
% 'sigl', 'bispectrum' 
%
% Cowen 2018 wrote this wrapper function.
% Uninformed opinions: duprelatour is nicest for better freq res. Tort has
% bad high freq resoluton and is slow. Canolty is good. Bispectrum is a bit
% strange.
% 
% Cowen 2020 - alowed chunking data. More testing. 
% NOTE: the python code by default dumps out 80 high frequencies bewween
% lowfq(max) and nyquist. (NOTE: pactools doc mistakenly says 40 bins. It's
% 80. Changing this is possible if we change the python code which would
% not be hard. 
%
% Started to work on surrogate approach for confidence intervals. Problem:
% the output does not seem reliable- even for simulated data. Makes no
% sense. Could it be my artificial data? I tried it with artificial data -
% seems to kinda work. I think that the issue is that the artifial data I
% created has a fixed perfect period and so regardless of the shifting, you
% still get CFC? Maybe. In contrast, real data - the frequency and period
% varies considerably so that shifting the phase or amplitude should have
% a much larger effect. That's my guess anyway. 
% THe bootstrapping is also obscenely slow (20 min for maybe 100) and so
% not practical for most situation.
