%function [peak_half_width, peak_to_trough] = Spike_width(WV,precision_multiplier)
% INPUT
%
%   nWaveforms x nPoints : a matrix of waveforms with each row
%     corresponding to a waveform.
%   precision_multiplier - how many times more precise than the passed in
%     data do you want the input data to be resampled to generate the output data.
%     for instance, if the waveforms are 32 points, a precision_multiplier of 10 should up it to 
%     320 points. A spline filter is applied to interpolate the waveform.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   peak_half_width - width (in data points passed in) of the peak at
%     1/2 its height.
%   peak_to_trough - the time from the peak to the trough.
%
%  If NO output is specified, a plot with diagostic points is presented for
%  verification.
%
% NOTE: THIS CODE SEEMS MESSED UP AT THE LINE THAT ASSIGNES half2 = 5. In
% general, it work's OK but before believing all of the results, run the
% program without any ouputs so that a diagnostic plot is created.
