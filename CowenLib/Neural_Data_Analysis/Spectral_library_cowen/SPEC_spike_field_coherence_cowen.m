% This uses two approaches. The one I trust the most computes the wavelet
% for the LFP around each spike and extracts the PHASE at each timepoint so
% you get a nfrequencies, ntimepoints, nspikes matrix. For each nfreqxntime
% point you compute a circular z test (rayleigh z) to determine if the
% phase is consistent across events(spikes) and get a p value.
% This produces a nice 2d plot of z or p of freq x time around spike.
%
% To me, this is much improved over the approach described in chronux or inHalje P, Tamte M, Richter U, Mohammed M, Cenci MA, Petersson P. 2012.

% which computes the psd of the STA. I think it's much better because the
% STA AVERAGES away any consistent phase relationships due to fluctionation
% in amplitude or due to phase relationships at different frequencies that
% oppose/cancel out each other. My approach is not mine and is a very standard approahc and
%
% There are issues with spurious phase locking due to non-stationary or
% bursty spikes. To address this, this function also calculates the values
% using a shuffled distribution of spikes. Due to the time it takes to
% compute this, it is only done a few times or once (some more analyses suggest that it can be faster than thought - especially if I use the HPC). Ideally we would
% compute a null distributoin of circ z scores and measure how far our z
% score deviates from this but that would take a long time if you have a
% lot of spikes and frequencies.
%
% TODO: Should despike the LFP before the STA computation to eliminate
% spurious effects caused by bursts where one spike is regulalry followed
% by another. Currently, the second spike would still have it's artifact in
% the LFP. I have the code in comments right now but will need validation.
