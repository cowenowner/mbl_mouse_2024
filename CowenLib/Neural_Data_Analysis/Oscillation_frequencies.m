O.delta = [1 3]; % actually, 2 is the typical cutoff, but sometimes 3. I start at 1 because the amplifiers are AC coupled so not sure about .5 Hz being really possible.
O.theta = [5 11]; % 10 is a somewhat average upper cutoff - Some say 8 Hz - but wait, others consider 12 as the upper cutoff (split the diff and chose 11): http://neuralcircuits.uwm.edu/theta-oscillations/
O.alpha = [9 14]; % alpha rhythms (8—10 Hz in humans, listed a little faster in rats) occur during relaxed wakefulness (Adrian and Yamagiwa, 1935)
O.beta  = [15 30]; % beta [25 37]
O.beta1 = [12 20]; % beta1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5088183/
O.beta2 = [20 30]; % beta2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5088183/
O.beta3 = [20 37]; % Looking at my rat data... 
O.low_gamma = [35 58]; % exploratory behaviour and perceptual tasks (Soltesz and Deschênes, 1993; Bragin et al., 1995; Csicsvari et al., 1999; Gray et al., 1989),
O.low_gamma_colgin = [31 55]; % From Laura Colgin's work.
O.low_gamma2 = [45 55]; %  See Ven der meer Redish paper where they define low gamma 50 as being 45-55 Hz (vSTR). Also see  Masimore et al. (2005) . This was determined by first JUST looking at peak gamma evoked by ketamine - this was then used to compare between drug groups or time..
O.gamma_50 = [45 55]; % Berke 2009 found this.  Meer MAA van der, Redish AD (2009). Low and High Gamma Oscillations in Rat Ventral Striatum have Distinct Relationships to Behavior, Reward, and Spiking Activity on a Learned Spatial Decision Task. Front Integr Neurosci 3: 9. NOTE: slightly differnet ranges in their 2010 paper.van der Meer et al., 2010
O.gamma_wideband = [35 75]; % Guyon et al. 2021 broadband ketamine induced gamma, added/subtracted 5 to avoid 80Hz and beta overlap - Abhi
% Arg - then in the 2017 piriform paper they call low gamma 45-65 Hz.
O.gamma_80 = [74 94]; % Berke 2009 found ~this but the upper end is aournd 100 hz. Meer MAA van der, Redish AD (2009).

% then again the newer vn der meer 2017 goes 70 to 90 Hz.
O.low_gamma_fenton = [35 55]; % From Laura Colgin's work.
O.med_gamma_fenton = [70 90]; % From Laura Colgin's work.
O.high_gamma_lindsey = [65 120]; % Colgin
O.high_gamma_colgin = [80 120]; % Colgin
O.high_gamma = [70 85]; % CITATION??? in our ripple stuff it goes up to 120. This may be incorrect.
O.fast_gamma = [90 140]; % RATS: Sullivan et al., 2011 CA3
O.HFO = [140 160]; % Constrained to what is observed in rats following ketamine injection.
O.HFO2 = [130 160]; % Constrained to what is observed in rats following ketamine injection.
O.ripple = [120 180]; % The lower bound is extended for aging animals.
O.ripple_young = [140 200]; % The lower bound is extended for aging animals.

O.ultra_HFO = [170 250];
O.fast_ripples = [250 800]; % recorded locally from the epileptogenic regions of the hippocampus and the temporal cortex of epileptic humans and rodents (Bragin et al., 1999b; Urrestarazu et al., 2007; Worrell et al., 2008),
