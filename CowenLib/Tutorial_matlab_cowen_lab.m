% This is a general matlab tutorial but geared to the ultimate analysis of
% neural data. It is 'quest based' in that it poses objectives without
% answers and then the student is charged with completing the quest. Book
% learning for matlab only gets you so far. You need to type stuff, err,
% and try and err again. Hints will be given in parentheses for each quest!
% Feel free to use the matlab help (doc <function>) or the web or Chat-GPT.

% Q1: create a histogram of 1000 random numbers with a mean of 10 and a standard
% deviation of 4. (randn, histogram)

% Q2: take your list of 1000 random numbers - also called a vector - and 1) add 10 2) divide by 14,
% 3) multiply by 20, and 4) do an element by element multiplication of that
% list with itself. (hint: .*)

% Q3: make 2 different vectors of random numbers with mean 5 and std of 2.
% Assign 1 to the variable V1 and another to the variable V2. Plot a
% scatter plot (plot using '.' or scatter) of V1 on the x axis and V2 on the y axis.

% Q4:
