function [y] = gaussian(x, mean, std);% GAUSSIAN%    [y] = gaussian(x, [mean], [std]) returns the gaussian value %    for each data value in matrix x.  Mean and standard deviation are%    optional.  Default values are mean = 0, std = 1;%    Note:  This function used to use the form of gaussian distribution%           which keeps the integral of the function constant across %           changes in the std, which has now been moved to the %           function "normal".%    y = exp( (-1/2)*((x-mean)./std).^2  );%%    Note that this function was recently (12/20/99) changed so that std refers%    to the actual standard deviation of the gaussian distribution%    old form was: y = exp( -1*((x-mean)./std).^2  );if nargin == 1 mean = 0; std = 1; end;if nargin == 2 std = 1; end;y = exp( (-1/2)*((x-mean)./std).^2  );
