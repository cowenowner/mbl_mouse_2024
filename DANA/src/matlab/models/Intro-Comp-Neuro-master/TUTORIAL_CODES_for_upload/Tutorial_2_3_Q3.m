% Variant of the Adaptive Exponential Leaky Integrate and Fire Model,
% a 2-variable model than can reproduce many types of neural behavior
% see Naud, Marcille, Clopath, Gerstner, Biol. Cybern. 2006
% This code loops through different applied currents.
% The adaptation term is altered in three ways:
% 1) It is a conductance rather than a current.
% 2) It has a time constant of 0.5ms, so acts as a refractory,
% rate-limiting term rather than a standard spike-rate adaptation term.
% 3) A tan function of voltage is used, so the conductance increases to
% very high levels if the membrane potential is high. The tan function is
% so steep that it can counteract excessively strong input currents that
% would otherwise cause the mean membrane potential to constantly grow with
% input. This prevents the firing rates from increasing without end.
%
% The threshold term is altered as in Method 2 of Tutorial 2.2, reaching a
% peak then decaying back to baseline following each spike.
% The reset potential is set to the baseline of the threshold, so plays a 
% greater role at higher rates when threshold is reached before it has 
% returned to baseline. 
% A dip in membrane potential following reset arises from the refractory
% conductance.
