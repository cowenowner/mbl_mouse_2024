% NPXL_Post_Process_Run
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The high-level code for running all of the post processing.
% Feel free to copy this and make a version for your own data
% post-processing. This code runs CatGT, extracts events, and
% filters/proceses .ap and .lf files for spike sorting.
%
% Expects:
% An event_codes.csv file in the top directory. It contains the event
% channel, variable name, and notes.
% C:\CatGT-win
% C:\TPrime-win
% Assumes CowenLib
%

% You must run kilosort manually throught the GUI.
% You must run Tprime after spike sorting to ensure aligned spikes and
% event times.
