How to install your python code so that it runs automatically on your Pico W:

In Thonny, save as or drag and drop the file (rename it to to main.py) to the RPI_... drive that loaded up in bootloader mode.
THEN UNPLUG FROM THE COMPUTER!!!! I missed this part. If you plut back into a computer, then the main.py will be removed automatically and replaced by the default program.

If this does not work, then restart and do this first and then repeat the save to main.py in Thonny.
1) Boot Pico in bootloader mode by holding down the BOOTSEL button while you plut into computer USB. 
[I think you only need to do this once or not at all if micropython.uf2 is installed]
