% Figure_9_5.m
%
% A code that generates a single inhomogeneous Poisson spike train, at a
% rate that changes discretely only once between two fixed values. 
%
% Then an algorithm calculates the log likelihood of the jump occurring at
% any point in the simulation.
%
% This code was used to produce Figure 9.5 in the textbook:
