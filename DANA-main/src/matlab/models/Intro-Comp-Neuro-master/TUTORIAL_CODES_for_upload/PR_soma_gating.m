function [ alpha_m, beta_m, alpha_h, beta_h , alpha_n, beta_n] = PR_soma_gating( Vm )
%PR_soma_gating returns the rate constants for the somatic gating variables
%of the Pinsky-Rinzel model, as a function of the membrane potential.
%
%   [ alpha_m, beta_m, alpha_h, beta_h , alpha_n, beta_n] = PR_soma_gating( Vm )
%   Input, Vm, should be somatic membrane potential (a scalar or a vector of
%   values).
%   Returned voltage-dependent rate constants are each of the same size as
%   the input membrane potential.
%   alpha_m is sodium activation rate constant
%   beta_m is sodium deactivation rate constant
%   alpha_h is sodium inactivation rate constant
%   beta_h is sodium deinactivation rate constant
%   alpha_n is potassium activation rate constant
%   beta_n is potassium deactivation rate constant
%
%
% Sodium and potassium gating variables are defined by the
% voltage-dependent transition rates between states, labeled alpha and
% beta.
