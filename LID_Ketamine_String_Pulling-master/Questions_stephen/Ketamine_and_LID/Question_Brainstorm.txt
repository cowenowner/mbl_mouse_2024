Does ketamine change:

Burstiness of neurons? Use a few measures: LV first.

Can you segment neurons by autocorr just like you can with firing rate? Does cell type predict this? Say width and peak to trough ratioN?

Sparsity? Does ketamine change this?

Spike PSDs. How do they change?

Bootstrap the distance measure to get confidence intervals to determine the degree of state change.

Correlate the degree of state change with the degree of movement change - could be a confound but needs to be accounted for. We will need to look for periods of similar movement when the animla was no on ketamine.

Some measure of entropy and compression - like the stuff I did with Abbott - does this change as a function of ketamine? I bet things get more entropic.
